          <div className="info-card">
            <p>
              Service providers earn badges based on their performance. For
              example, if a provider receives 10 positive ratings and no more
              than 3 negative ratings, they earn the "Top Rated" badge. Badges
              contribute to the provider's composite score, which determines
              their tier level.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Example:</strong> Provider A earns the "Top Rated" badge,
              contributing to their composite score. Over time, they accumulate
              20 positive ratings and minimal negative feedback, advancing to
              the "Rookie" tier.

            <h3>Low Price Badge Example:</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>Initial Loss:</strong> Provider receives 6 negative
                ratings for high prices and loses the "Low Price" badge.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Adjust Pricing:</strong> Provider reviews and adjusts
                their pricing to be more competitive.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Customer Feedback:</strong> Provider actively seeks and
                monitors customer feedback, addressing pricing concerns
                promptly.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Service Improvement:</strong> Provider improves overall
                service quality, encouraging positive reviews.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Negative Badge Expiry:</strong> Older negative badges
                (older than 6 months) are removed from the provider's history.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Earn Positive Feedback:</strong> Provider earns 10 new
                positive ratings for competitive pricing without more than 3 new
                negative ratings.
              </li>
